File 'spam-ham-datset.csv' contains the dataset used for fitting the model.

File 'Q1_functions.py' contains the functions used in the algorithms in problems Q1_NB.py, Q1_SVM.py and Q1_predict.py.

Q1_NB.py contains the model fitting for Naive Bayes algorithm and Q1_SVM.py contains the model fitting for SVM algorithm.

Q1_predict.py predicts the output label for each txt file in 'test' folder.

The code files generate print outputs on the terminal and saves the plots for confusion matrices obtained as png files with appropriate names like 'Fig_Q1_NB_train_cm.py' for confusion matrix obtained in Naive Bayes algorithm for train dataset.
